# C-Projet-Registration-of-3D-Points  

Graduation design - Robot vision - Registration of 3D Points  

This is my research on machine vision when I graduated from undergraduate design.  

The environment configuration is: visualstudio2013 + PCL1.8.0 (Point Cloud Library)  

There are three folders in total:  

The program represents the source code for processing the 3D point cloud. Only the .cpp file is uploaded, and the environment can be configured by yourself.  

Human-machine interface design is to use C # audit to remember the interface and source code of point cloud processing software  

The platform control is based on the control of the servo camera platform by PLC. Through the one-to-one matching of the control signals stored in the registers, the serial communication module designed by Qt's serial communication module and the platform control interface
