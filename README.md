Graduation design - Robot vision - Registration of 3D Points  

This is my Bachlor graduation designresearch on Robot vision.  

The environment configuration is: visualstudio2013 + PCL1.8.0 (Point Cloud Library)  

There are three folders in total:  

The program represents the source code for processing the 3D point cloud. Only the .cpp file is uploaded, and the environment can be configured by yourself.  

Human-machine interface design is to use C# to design an interface. The materials included and the source code of point cloud processing software has been uploaded.

The platform control is based on the control of the servo camera platform by PLC. Through the one-to-one matching of the control signals stored in the registers, and the platform-control interface is designed by Qt abd its serial communication module .
